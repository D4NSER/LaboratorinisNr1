## Specs
#### To start this project's review, I need to give a little intro about my computer. I have a MacBook, with these specs:
    CPU: 2,3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5 
    RAM: 6 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3 
    SSD: Macintosh HD 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> All of the testing was done with the same files that contained 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000 students.

> [!NOTE]
> P.S. Changing structure's type from vector into list or deque, programs speed would actually change.

**DATA READING**: The impact on reading might not be significant and caught by a human eye, but if we change **_vector_** into either **_list_** or **_deque_** the time would be a little bit smaller 

**SORTING DATA**: 
- **_Vector_** provides the fastest sorting because it allows random access (RA), which is super good for _quicksort_ algorithm used in _sort_.
- **_List_** has it's own _sort_ method which is optimized for list operations. It is **slower** than **_vector_** because it cannot access random access (RA). It is quite fast because it is designed for quick and efficient insertions and deletions.
- **_Deque_** is the slowest from these 3 because it doesn't support access to random access (RA) and is not designed for it, making it the **slowest** one.

**DIVIDING STUDENTS**: 
- Using **_vector_** dividing might involve a lot of element shifting, especially if you're erasing elements from the middle.
- **_List_** should be more efficient than a **_vector_** for dividing because it can insert and remove elements without shifting others.
- **_Deque_** is better than a vector for middle insertions/removals but not as efficient as a list because of it's design.

In summary, if the structure of Studentas is changed from a **_vector_** to a **_list_** or **_deque_**, you might see improved performance in certain operations (like dividing students) due to the **_list's_** and **_deque's_** efficient insertion and deletion capabilities. However, sorting might be slower, especially for **_deque_**. The exact impact would depend on the specific operations and how they are implemented.

> [!WARNING]
> When doing these tests try to do as many as you can, because from the first sight, the differences may not be seen because of the varying time all of the actions take

### Implementing this strategy:
- **_Vector_**: May have some problems when splitting students into 2 containers because of the need for additional memory.
- **_List_**: They don't require any additional memory when splitting students into 2 dfferent containers, but they are slower than vectors because of slower random acccess (RA).
- **_Deque_**: They are much more efficient when it comes to splitting compared to others. They support insertion and deletion from all ends. They offer quite a fast reading and insertion but are still slower than vectors due to no access to random access (RA).

>[!NOTE]
>In comparison, vectors excel in reading speed but suffer in sorting time compared to lists and deques. Lists offer quicker sorting but slower reading compared to vectors. Deques provide an intermediary performance, particularly when splitting occurs infrequently but still aren't very fast.

### Implementing this strategy:
- **_Vector_**: Using it, time increases with the number of students because of slower element removal even though reading and sorting are pretty much not affected due to fast random access (RA). Performance differentiates because of file sizes.
- **_List_**: Allos quick ellement removal and efficient classification. However, when it comes to sorting, list times get much longer due to random access (RA) issues, especially with large files.
- **_Deque_**: Student classification and sorting times are pretty fast but reading data is tragicly slow.

>[!NOTE]
>Considering all factors (reading time, sorting time, element removal time), the most effective strategy is to use the Vectors container. Despite potential slowdowns in element removal, vectors boast fast reading and sorting times due to their swift access capabilities. This makes them ideal for student classification tasks, especially when dealing with extensive files. Therefore, vectors emerge as the optimal choice, providing a balance between performance and efficiency in this scenario.
